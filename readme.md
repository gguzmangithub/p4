## Details for teaching team
There are many areas for future development.  Including :
- Improvement of Executing queries
- Adding a cart feature which would include linking to PayPal for credit card payments
-Remembering pet names in user profile so they can select from a drop down which pet to order for
-Making a more dynamic ordering page (clickable thumbnail images)
-Use photos of actual products to be incorporated into website, not generic pictures found on web.
-Expand the model for size, create an independent table for accessories and treat sizes and prices and connect the tables, remove size & price columns from treat & accessory table
-Increasing information about users (billing address, mailing address, option to be included on a mailing list for future promotions, etc.)
